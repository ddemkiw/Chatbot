Reflections

This was the first proper ruby program that I created for Makers Academy and to this day I am pleased with the result.
I vividly remember breaking up my code into small methods that I could re-use at different parts of the program 
even thought I had no idea what I was doing or why what I was doing was important. In retrospect, this was the beginning 
of a life long journey into OOO Design.
